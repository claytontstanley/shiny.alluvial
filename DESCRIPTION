Description: This is a visualization tool to better understand workflows based on timestamped, labeled data.
	Most of the initial .js and .html was from the rCharts_d3_sankey package.
	However that package uses a problematic sankey visualization where the history of the session is not maintained.
	This causes paths in that diagram to cross, which is confusing. 
	With this visualization history is kept so the charts look more like funnels from a specific starting point, with no edge crossing.
	The chart is interactive. Clicking on a node re-anchors the visualization to show all workflows that occur after that initial start point.
	RShiny is used to create the interactivity.
	This visualization likely has many uses for various sessionized data. We've used it to visualize user journeys based on log data.
	The API consists of a single function, runAppSK. Calling this function with a properly-formatted data table will launch a browser that shows the viz.
